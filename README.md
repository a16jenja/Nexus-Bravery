# Nexus-Bravery
This project was created with React. Check it out here: https://a16jenja.github.io/Nexus-Bravery/

A quick random hero picker and random talent generator for the game Heroes of the Storm to have some fun with.

The hero list including all the heroes from the game to choose from is hardcoded. Therefore, when a new hero is released that hero must be added manually. A better way to solve this would be to get the heroes available from an API, this is something that might be added in the future.

The talents that each hero have and what the talents do are updated with the API from the site https://heroespatchnotes.github.io/heroes-talents/hero/. This means that talent descriptions are up to date with patch changes.
